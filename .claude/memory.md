# Watch Tower Project Memory

## ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL PROJECT PRIORITY**

**Primary Value Proposition**: Truck locations come from LocoNav API. The most important functionality is LLMs using LocoNav APIs & webhooks as tools to answer natural language questions about fleet status.

**Core Use Case**: AI service must be able to query "Where is truck T11985LA?" and get real location data from LocoNav. Everything else is secondary infrastructure.

**Business Impact**: This natural language interface to fleet data is what transforms VPC's manual operations into AI-powered efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ **Celery Background Processing - Use & Need**

### Why Celery is Essential

**Problem**: Fleet operations require continuous background work that can't block user interactions:
- **Data Sync**: Google Sheets â†” Database (every 15 minutes)
- **Analytics**: Daily fleet metrics calculation (6 AM Lagos time)
- **Monitoring**: Vehicle connectivity checks (every 5 minutes)
- **Alerts**: Proactive delay detection and Slack notifications
- **Cleanup**: Data archival and maintenance tasks

### How Celery Solves This

**Async Task Processing**: Offloads heavy work from API responses
```python
# User gets immediate response
@app.post("/trips")
async def create_trip(trip_data):
    # Quick database insert
    trip = await create_trip_record(trip_data)
    
    # Heavy LocoNav API calls happen in background
    sync_with_loconav.delay(trip.id)
    
    return {"trip_id": trip.id, "status": "created"}
```

**Scheduled Operations**: Reliable automation without human intervention
- **6 AM**: Generate daily analytics
- **Every 15 min**: Sync with Google Sheets
- **Every 5 min**: Check vehicle connectivity

**Fault Tolerance**: Retries, dead letter queues, monitoring
- Failed Google Sheets sync? Retry with exponential backoff
- LocoNav API down? Queue requests for later processing

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL HALLUCINATION DISCOVERY**

**Date**: 2024-12-28  
**Issue**: LocoNav implementation was completely wrong - massive hallucination detected

### **What Was Wrong**:
```bash
# HALLUCINATED .env (WRONG)
LOCONAV_API_KEY=...           # Doesn't exist
LOCONAV_API_SECRET=...        # Doesn't exist  
LOCONAV_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...    # Not documented
LOCONAV_BASE_URL=https://api.loconav.com  # Wrong URL
```

### **Actual LocoNav Requirements** (from docs):
```bash
# CORRECT .env
LOCONAV_USER_TOKEN=PRJX5q4K5Yhn7FFWfuTx
LOCONAV_BASE_URL=https://api.a.loconav.com
```

### **Authentication Reality**:
- **ONLY** requires single User Token  
- Header: `User-Authentication: {{token}}`
- **NO API key/secret pattern**
- **NO webhook secrets in docs**

### **Critical Pattern Identified**:
**Problem**: Implementation claims completion without reading actual API documentation
**Impact**: Services won't work with real credentials due to wrong auth method & URL
**Risk**: Similar hallucinations likely exist in other "completed" services

### **NEW MANDATORY PROCESS**:
Before marking any external integration as "complete", MUST:
1. **Read the actual API docs thoroughly**
2. **Verify authentication method matches docs exactly**  
3. **Test with real credentials**
4. **Document what was hallucinated vs real**

**USER PROVIDED REAL TOKEN**: `LOCONAV_USER_TOKEN=PRJX5q4K5Yhn7FFWfuTx`

## ðŸ§  **Deeper Analysis: Validation Strategy**

### Current Reality Check Needed

**We claim these work but haven't tested**:
1. **LocoNav Service**: Can we actually fetch truck locations?
2. **API Endpoints**: Do `/api/v1/trucks` endpoints return data?
3. **Celery Tasks**: Are background jobs actually running?
4. **Redis Streams**: Are events publishing/consuming correctly?

### Validation Priority Order

**1. LocoNav API Integration** (CRITICAL)
- Test actual truck location retrieval
- Verify authentication works
- Check rate limits and error handling

**2. Core API Endpoints** (HIGH)
- Test truck CRUD operations
- Verify response formats match schemas
- Check database connectivity

**3. Background Processing** (MEDIUM)
- Test Celery task execution
- Verify scheduled tasks run
- Check Redis connectivity

**4. Event Streams** (LOW)
- Test Redis Streams publishing
- Verify consumer groups work
- Check event routing

### Decision Tree

```
IF LocoNav works + APIs work:
  â†’ Fix AI service to use real data
  â†’ Natural language queries become powerful

IF LocoNav broken OR APIs broken:
  â†’ Fix foundation first
  â†’ AI service needs working data layer

IF everything broken:
  â†’ Rebuild from ground up
  â†’ Start with LocoNav integration
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps Based on Validation**

**Phase 1: Foundation Validation** (1 week)
- Test LocoNav API with real credentials
- Validate core API endpoints
- Check Celery background processing

**Phase 2: Choose Path** (Based on Phase 1 results)
- **Path A**: Foundation works â†’ Fix AI service for natural language
- **Path B**: Foundation broken â†’ Rebuild core systems first

**Phase 3: Integration** (2-3 weeks)
- Connect working AI to working LocoNav
- Test end-to-end: "Where is truck T11985LA?" â†’ Real location
- Deploy webhook receiver for real-time updates

This approach ensures we build AI on solid foundation rather than more scaffolding.
