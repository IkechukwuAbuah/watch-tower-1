# Watch Tower - VPC Fleet Tracking System

## 🚛 Overview

Watch Tower is an intelligent fleet tracking and management system for Virgo Point Capital (VPC), built to streamline container trucking operations in Lagos, Nigeria. The system integrates with LocoNav's GPS tracking API and provides a conversational AI interface for fleet managers to monitor trucks, create trips, and analyze performance.

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Real-time Fleet Tracking**: Monitor 84+ trucks with live GPS data from LocoNav
- **Natural Language Interface**: Query fleet status and create trips via Slack bot
- **Trip Management**: Create, track, and analyze container trips between terminals and client locations
- **Performance Analytics**: Daily/weekly summaries, TAT metrics, and fleet utilization
- **Geofence Monitoring**: Automatic alerts for terminal/client location entry/exit
- **Data Synchronization**: Bi-directional sync between Google Sheets and database

## 💡 Problem We're Solving

VPC currently loses ₦10M+ monthly due to:
- **Manual Operations**: 5-7 minutes to create each trip
- **Poor Visibility**: No real-time fleet overview
- **Fragmented Data**: Information split between LocoNav and Google Sheets
- **Delayed Reporting**: 3+ hours daily on manual reports

Watch Tower transforms these operations through AI-powered automation, reducing trip creation to <1 minute and providing instant fleet visibility through natural language commands.

- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Supabase account
- LocoNav API credentials
- Slack workspace & bot token
- Google Sheets API access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
cd ~/Downloads/watch-tower-experiments/watch-tower-1

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

## 📊 Data Sources

1. **LocoNav API**: Real-time GPS tracking, trip management, geofencing
2. **Google Sheets**: Master data for trucks, drivers, clients, locations
3. **Supabase**: Central database for synced data and analytics

## 🤖 AI Capabilities

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to understand natural language queries like:
- "Where is truck T11985LA?"
- "Create trip for T28737LA from ESSLIBRA to ECLAT tomorrow 8am"
- "Show me all delays in the last 24 hours"
- "Which trucks are at terminals?"

## 📱 Interfaces

1. **Slack Bot** (Primary interface)
   - Natural language commands
   - Real-time notifications
   - Daily summaries

2. **Web Dashboard** (Phase 3)
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Trip progress tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - No complex maps (users use LocoNav for detailed tracking)

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- API authentication via tokens
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Data encryption in transit
- Lagos timezone (Africa/Lagos) for all timestamps

## 📈 Key Metrics Tracked

- **Truck Turnaround Time (TTT)**
- **Trips per truck**
- **Trip Completion Accuracy (%)**
- **Fleet utilization by category (VPC, LH, FM, PC)**
- **Delays and breakdown analysis**
