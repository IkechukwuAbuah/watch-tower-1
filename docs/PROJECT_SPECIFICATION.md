# Watch Tower - Project Specification

## 1. Executive Summary

Watch Tower is a fleet management system designed to optimize container trucking operations for Virgo Point Capital (VPC) in Lagos, Nigeria. The system bridges the gap between LocoNav's GPS tracking capabilities and VPC's operational needs through intelligent automation and natural language interfaces.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges:
- **Manual Trip Creation**: Time-consuming process in LocoNav
- **Inconsistent Reporting**: Delayed and irregular performance reports
- **Data Fragmentation**: Information spread across LocoNav and Google Sheets
- **Limited Visibility**: No unified view of fleet performance and trip status
- **Communication Gaps**: Difficulty in getting real-time fleet information

### Business Impact:
- Delayed decision-making due to lack of real-time insights
- Inefficient truck utilization
- Manual tracking leading to errors and oversights
- Lost revenue from suboptimal turnaround times

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Components:

#### 3.1 Data Integration Layer
- **Google Sheets Sync**: Automated 15-minute sync of master data

#### 3.2 AI-Powered Assistant
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand fleet queries in plain English
- **Smart Trip Creation**: Simplify trip setup through conversation
- **Proactive Alerts**: Notify about delays and anomalies

#### 3.3 Analytics Engine
