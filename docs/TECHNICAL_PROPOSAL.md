# Watch Tower - Fleet Tracking System Technical Proposal

## What problem are you trying to solve?

VPC operates 84+ container trucks in Lagos, Nigeria, using LocoNav for GPS tracking. Currently, our operations team faces significant friction in daily fleet management tasks:

- **Trip creation takes 10-15 minutes** per trip through LocoNav's complex UI
- **Fleet visibility requires multiple clicks** to answer simple questions like "where is truck T11985LA?"
- **Performance reporting is inconsistent**, with managers manually compiling data from multiple sources
- **Critical alerts get lost** in email/SMS, lacking context and actionability

We need a unified, intelligent interface that simplifies fleet operations while maintaining the robust tracking capabilities of LocoNav.

## üìñ Background

### Current State
- **Fleet Size**: 84 trucks across 4 operators (VPC, FM, LH, PC)
- **Daily Operations**: ~45 container trips between ESSLIBRA terminal and client locations
- **Data Sources**: 
  - LocoNav (GPS tracking, trip management, geofencing)
  - Google Sheets (master data for trucks, drivers, clients, locations)
  - Manual tracking sheets for trip progress

### Pain Points Observed
1. Operations team spends 2+ hours daily on repetitive data entry
2. Delayed response to trip delays due to poor alert visibility  
3. Management lacks real-time fleet utilization metrics
4. Customer complaints about shipment visibility

### Previous Attempts
- Excel macros for reporting (broke frequently)
- WhatsApp groups for alerts (too noisy, no context)
- Direct LocoNav access for all team members (too complex)

## ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why should we solve it?

### Quantitative Impact
- **Time Savings**: 2.5 hours/day √ó 5 operators = 12.5 hours daily
- **Trip Creation**: Reduce from 15 min to 2 min = 85% improvement
- **Response Time**: Alert to action from 45 min to 5 min
- **Revenue Impact**: 20% more trips possible with optimized TAT

### Qualitative Impact
- **Team Morale**: Reduce frustration with repetitive tasks
- **Decision Making**: Real-time data for better resource allocation
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Proactive delay notifications
- **Competitive Advantage**: Faster turnaround than competitors

### Cost of Inaction
- Losing 1-2 trips per truck monthly due to inefficiency
- Risk of losing contracts to more tech-enabled competitors
- Growing operational costs as fleet expands

## üìì Requirements

### Core Problem
Our fleet operations team needs a conversational interface to manage trips and monitor trucks without navigating complex UIs or switching between multiple systems.

### Functional Requirements
1. **Natural Language Fleet Queries**
   - "Where is truck T11985LA?"
   - "Which trucks are at ESSLIBRA terminal?"
   - "Show delays in the last 24 hours"

2. **Simplified Trip Creation**
   - Create trips via Slack: "Create trip T28737LA from ESSLIBRA to ECLAT tomorrow 8am"
   - Auto-populate from master data
   - Validate truck availability

3. **Proactive Intelligence**
   - Alert on trip delays (2+ hours after scheduled departure)
   - Geofence entry/exit notifications during active trips
   - Daily/weekly performance summaries

4. **Data Synchronization**
   - Bi-directional sync with Google Sheets (15-min intervals)
   - Real-time GPS data from LocoNav
   - Historical data retention (6 months)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds for queries
- 99.5% uptime for critical services
- Support Lagos timezone (Africa/Lagos)
- Mobile-friendly interfaces

### What are you not trying to solve?
- Route optimization (drivers know best routes)
- Customer billing integration
- Driver performance scoring
- Maintenance scheduling
- Fuel management

## üíΩ Data Model

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Trucks (synced from Sheets)
CREATE TABLE trucks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    truck_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    loconav_vehicle_id VARCHAR(100),
    company VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(50),
    INDEX idx_truck_number (truck_number)
);

-- Trips (operational data)
CREATE TABLE trips (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    vpc_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    loconav_trip_id VARCHAR(100),
    truck_id UUID REFERENCES trucks(id),
    pickup_location_id UUID,
    delivery_location_id UUID,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    scheduled_departure TIMESTAMP,
    actual_departure TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_status_schedule (status, scheduled_departure)
);

-- Vehicle Positions (time-series)
CREATE TABLE vehicle_positions (
    truck_id UUID,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    coordinates POINT,
    speed DECIMAL(5,2),
