# # Managing Function Calls With Reasoning Models
# OpenAI now offers function calling using [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?api-mode=responses). Reasoning models are trained to follow logical chains of thought, making them better suited for complex or multi-step tasks.
# > _Reasoning models like o3 and o4-mini are LLMs trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning. Reasoning models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning for agentic workflows. They're also the best models for Codex CLI, our lightweight coding agent._
# 
# For the most part, using these models via the API is very simple and comparable to using familiar 'chat' models. 
# 
# However, there are some nuances to bear in mind, particularly when it comes to using features such as function calling. 
# 
# All examples in this notebook use the newer [Responses API](https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-the-responses-api/1140929) which provides convenient abstractions for managing conversation state. However the principles here are relevant when using the older chat completions API.

# ## Making API calls to reasoning models

# In[1]:


# pip install openai
# Import libraries 
import json
from openai import OpenAI
from uuid import uuid4
from typing import Callable

client = OpenAI()
MODEL_DEFAULTS = {
    "model": "o4-mini", # 200,000 token context window
    "reasoning": {"effort": "low", "summary": "auto"}, # Automatically summarise the reasoning process. Can also choose "detailed" or "none"
}


# Let's make a simple call to a reasoning model using the Responses API.
# We specify a low reasoning effort and retrieve the response with the helpful `output_text` attribute.
# We can ask follow up questions and use the `previous_response_id` to let OpenAI manage the conversation history automatically

# In[2]:


response = client.responses.create(
    input="Which of the last four Olympic host cities has the highest average temperature?",
    **MODEL_DEFAULTS
)
print(response.output_text)

response = client.responses.create(
    input="what about the lowest?",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    **MODEL_DEFAULTS
)
print(response.output_text)


# Nice and easy!
# 
# We're asking relatively complex questions that may require the model to reason out a plan and proceed through it in steps, but this reasoning is hidden from us - we simply wait a little longer before being shown the response. 
# 
# However, if we inspect the output we can see that the model has made use of a hidden set of 'reasoning' tokens that were included in the model context window, but not exposed to us as end users.
# We can see these tokens and a summary of the reasoning (but not the literal tokens used) in the response.

# In[3]:


print(next(rx for rx in response.output if rx.type == 'reasoning').summary[0].text)
response.usage.to_dict()


# It is important to know about these reasoning tokens, because it means we will consume our available context window more quickly than with traditional chat models.
# 
# ## Calling custom functions
# What happens if we ask the model a complex request that also requires the use of custom tools?
# * Let's imagine we have more questions about Olympic Cities, but we also have an internal database that contains IDs for each city.
# * It's possible that the model will need to invoke our tool partway through its reasoning process before returning a result.
# * Let's make a function that produces a random UUID and ask the model to reason about these UUIDs. 
# 

# In[4]:


def get_city_uuid(city: str) -> str:
    """Just a fake tool to return a fake UUID"""
    uuid = str(uuid4())
    return f"{city} ID: {uuid}"

# The tool schema that we will pass to the model
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_city_uuid",
        "description": "Retrieve the internal ID for a city from the internal database. Only invoke this function if the user needs to know the internal ID for a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "city": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city to get information about"}
            },
            "required": ["city"]
        }
    }
]

# This is a general practice - we need a mapping of the tool names we tell the model about, and the functions that implement them.
tool_mapping = {
    "get_city_uuid": get_city_uuid
}

# Let's add this to our defaults so we don't have to pass it every time
MODEL_DEFAULTS["tools"] = tools

response = client.responses.create(
    input="What's the internal ID for the lowest-temperature city?",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    **MODEL_DEFAULTS)
print(response.output_text)


# We didn't get an `output_text` this time. Let's look at the response output

# In[5]:


response.output


# Along with the reasoning step, the model has successfully identified the need for a tool call and passed back instructions to send to our function call. 
# 
# Let's invoke the function and send the results to the model so it can continue reasoning.
# Function responses are a special kind of message, so we need to structure our next message as a special kind of input:
# ```json
# {
#     "type": "function_call_output",
#     "call_id": function_call.call_id,
#     "output": tool_output
# }
# ```

# In[6]:


# Extract the function call(s) from the response
new_conversation_items = []
function_calls = [rx for rx in response.output if rx.type == 'function_call']
for function_call in function_calls:
    target_tool = tool_mapping.get(function_call.name)
    if not target_tool:
        raise ValueError(f"No tool found for function call: {function_call.name}")
    arguments = json.loads(function_call.arguments) # Load the arguments as a dictionary
    tool_output = target_tool(**arguments) # Invoke the tool with the arguments
    new_conversation_items.append({
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": function_call.call_id, # We map the response back to the original function call
        "output": tool_output
    })


# In[7]:


response = client.responses.create(
    input=new_conversation_items,
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    **MODEL_DEFAULTS
)
print(response.output_text)


# This works great here - as we know that a single function call is all that is required for the model to respond - but we also need to account for situations where multiple tool calls might need to be executed for the reasoning to complete.
# 
# Let's add a second call to run a web search.
# 
# OpenAI's web search tool is not available out of the box with reasoning models (as of May 2025 - this may soon change) but it's not too hard to create a custom web search function using 4o mini or another web search enabled model.

# In[8]:


def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information and return back a summary of the results"""
    result = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        input=f"Search the web for '{query}' and reply with only the result.",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    )
    return result.output_text

tools.append({
        "type": "function",
        "name": "web_search",
        "description": "Search the web for information and return back a summary of the results",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",

            },
            "required": ["query"]
        }
    })
tool_mapping["web_search"] = web_search


# ## Executing multiple functions in series
# 
# Some OpenAI models support the parameter `parallel_tool_calls` which allows the model to return an array of functions which we can then execute in parallel. However, reasoning models may produce a sequence of function calls that must be made in series, particularly as some steps may depend on the results of previous ones.
# As such, we ought to define a general pattern which we can use to handle arbitrarily complex reasoning workflows:
# * At each step in the conversation, initialise a loop
# * If the response contains function calls, we must assume the reasoning is ongoing and we should feed the function results (and any intermediate reasoning) back into the model for further inference
# * If there are no function calls and we instead receive a Reponse.output with a type of 'message', we can safely assume the agent has finished reasoning and we can break out of the loop

# In[9]:


# Let's wrap our logic above into a function which we can use to invoke tool calls.

# ## Manual conversation orchestration
# So far so good! It's really cool to watch the model pause execution to run a function before continuing. 
# In practice the example above is quite trivial, and production use cases may be much more complex:
# * Our context window may grow too large and we may wish to prune older and less relevant messages, or summarize the conversation so far
# * We may wish to allow users to navigate back and forth through the conversation and re-generate answers
# * We may wish to store messages in our own database for audit purposes rather than relying on OpenAI's storage and orchestration
# * etc.
# 
# In these situations we may wish to take full control of the conversation. Rather than using `previous_message_id` we can instead treat the API as 'stateless' and make and maintain an array of conversation items that we send to the model as input each time.
# 
# This poses some Reasoning model specific nuances to consider. 
# * In particular, it is essential that we preserve any reasoning and function call responses in our conversation history.
# * This is how the model keeps track of what chain-of-thought steps it has run through. The API will error if these are not included.
# 
# Let's run through the example above again, orchestrating the messages ourselves and tracking token usage.

# ## Summary
# In this cookbook, we identified how to combine function calling with OpenAI's reasoning models to demonstrate multi-step tasks that are dependent on external data sources., including searching the web.
# 
# Importantly, we covered reasoning-model specific nuances in the function calling process, specifically that:
# * The model may choose to make multiple function calls or reasoning steps in series, and some steps may depend on the results of previous ones
# * We cannot know how many of these steps there will be, so we must process responses with a loop
# * The responses API makes orchestration easy using the `previous_response_id` parameter, but where manual control is needed, it's important to maintain the correct order of conversation item to preserve the 'chain-of-thought'
#

# 
# The examples used here are rather simple, but you can imagine how this technique could be extended to more real-world use cases, such as:
# 
# * Looking up a customer's transaction history and recent correspondence to determine if they are eligible for a promotional offer
# * Calling recent transaction logs, geolocation data, and device metadata to assess the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent
# * Reviewing internal HR databases to fetch an employee’s benefits usage, tenure, and recent policy changes to answer personalized HR questions
# * Reading internal dashboards, competitor news feeds, and market analyses to compile a daily executive briefing tailored to their focus areas
