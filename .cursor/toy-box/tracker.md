## Implementation Log

### Date: June 27, 2025

#### Session 1: Planning & Process Setup
- ✅ Created toy-box directory structure
- ✅ Analyzed current codebase state
- ✅ Created problem statement document
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan
- ✅ Created systems architecture document
- ✅ Created this tracker
- ✅ Established workflow process documentation
- ✅ Created error tracking template
- ✅ Created Cursor Rules for project navigation

#### Session 2: Phase 1 Foundation Implementation
- ✅ Created feature branch `feat/phase-1-foundation`
- ✅ Added PostGIS geography types to all models
- ✅ Created comprehensive Pydantic schemas (282 lines)
- ✅ Implemented async database session management
- ✅ Replaced all placeholder API endpoints
- ✅ Created LocoNav webhook service with HMAC verification
- ✅ Implemented Google Sheets sync service
- ✅ Built analytics service with spatial queries
- ✅ Created initial Alembic migration
- ✅ Committed and created PR #14 (MERGED)

#### Session 3: Redis Streams Event Sourcing (Issue #8)
- ✅ Created feature branch `feat/redis-streams-event-sourcing`
- ✅ Created core configuration module with Redis settings
- ✅ Implemented Redis connection pool management
- ✅ Designed comprehensive event schemas (8 event types)
- ✅ Built EventPublisher for publishing to Redis Streams
- ✅ Created EventConsumer with consumer groups support
- ✅ Implemented event handlers for core events
- ✅ Integrated Redis into main app startup/shutdown
- ✅ Updated webhooks to publish events
- ✅ Updated LocoNav service to publish position/trip events
- ✅ Created test script for event system
- ✅ Documented event sourcing architecture

#### Next Steps (Executor Mode)
1. Create additional database models (Driver, Organization, Analytics)
2. Implement Redis Streams for event sourcing
3. Set up OpenAI Responses API integration
4. Configure Celery for background tasks

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
- None yet

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Workflow process unclear → Created comprehensive workflow documentation
- ✅ Cursor navigation → Created Cursor Rules

## Questions for Human User

1. **Supabase Configuration**: Need to verify Supabase project URL and keys
2. **Google Sheets**: Which specific sheets need to be synced?
3. **Redis Streams**: Should we implement event sourcing immediately or start simpler?
4. **Webhook Service**: Should this be a separate microservice or part of main API?

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- API Response Time: <500ms p95
- Geofence Query: <50ms
- Trip Creation: <1 minute
- Sheets Sync: <2 minutes for full sync

### Current Metrics
- TBD - Will measure after implementation

## Dependencies Status

### External Services
- [ ] LocoNav API credentials verified
- [ ] Google Sheets API enabled
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured
- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Redis instance available

### Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Async SQLAlchemy 2 in requirements
- ✅ PostGIS support in db/session.py
- ✅ Redis client in requirements
- ✅ OpenAI SDK updated (>=1.35.0)
- ✅ All O3 recommended packages
- [ ] geoalchemy2 for PostGIS types (to be verified)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| PostGIS complexity | Medium | Low | Start simple, optimize later | Monitoring |
| LocoNav API limits | High | Medium | Implement caching and rate limiting | Planning |
| Google Sheets quotas | Medium | High | Batch operations, 15-min sync | Planning |
| AI accuracy | Medium | Medium | Start with deterministic queries | Planning |

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Session 1 Feedback
- Planning phase completed successfully
- Workflow process now clearly documented
- Cursor Rules created for better navigation
- Ready to switch to Executor mode for implementation
- First task: Update database models with PostGIS types

### Pending Decisions
1. Should we create a separate webhook microservice immediately?
2. Do we need all PostGIS features upfront or can we migrate gradually?
3. Redis Streams implementation - immediate or phased?

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- Project already has async SQLAlchemy 2 configured (good foundation)
- PostGIS extensions already enabled in db/session.py
- Basic models exist but need geography type upgrades

### Process Insights
- O3 plan is comprehensive but we should implement incrementally
- Focus on getting core functionality working first
- Event sourcing can be added after basic features work
- Clear workflow documentation essential for multi-mode operation
- Cursor Rules help maintain consistency across sessions
