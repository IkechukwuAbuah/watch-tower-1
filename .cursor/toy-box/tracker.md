## Implementation Log

### Date: [Current Date]

#### Session 1: Planning & Process Setup
- ✅ Created toy-box directory structure
- ✅ Analyzed current codebase state
- ✅ Created problem statement document
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan
- ✅ Created systems architecture document
- ✅ Created this tracker
- ✅ Established workflow process documentation
- ✅ Created error tracking template
- ✅ Created Cursor Rules for project navigation

#### Next Steps (Executor Mode)
1. Start with database models - upgrade to PostGIS types
2. Create comprehensive Pydantic schemas
3. Implement Google Sheets service
4. Wire up real API endpoints

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
- None yet

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Workflow process unclear → Created comprehensive workflow documentation
- ✅ Cursor navigation → Created Cursor Rules

## Questions for Human User

1. **Supabase Configuration**: Need to verify Supabase project URL and keys
2. **Google Sheets**: Which specific sheets need to be synced?
3. **Redis Streams**: Should we implement event sourcing immediately or start simpler?
4. **Webhook Service**: Should this be a separate microservice or part of main API?

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- API Response Time: <500ms p95
- Geofence Query: <50ms
- Trip Creation: <1 minute
- Sheets Sync: <2 minutes for full sync

### Current Metrics
- TBD - Will measure after implementation

## Dependencies Status

### External Services
- [ ] LocoNav API credentials verified
- [ ] Google Sheets API enabled
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured
- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Redis instance available

### Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Async SQLAlchemy 2 in requirements
- ✅ PostGIS support in db/session.py
- ✅ Redis client in requirements
- ✅ OpenAI SDK updated (>=1.35.0)
- ✅ All O3 recommended packages
- [ ] geoalchemy2 for PostGIS types (to be verified)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| PostGIS complexity | Medium | Low | Start simple, optimize later | Monitoring |
| LocoNav API limits | High | Medium | Implement caching and rate limiting | Planning |
| Google Sheets quotas | Medium | High | Batch operations, 15-min sync | Planning |
| AI accuracy | Medium | Medium | Start with deterministic queries | Planning |

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Session 1 Feedback
- Planning phase completed successfully
- Workflow process now clearly documented
- Cursor Rules created for better navigation
- Ready to switch to Executor mode for implementation
- First task: Update database models with PostGIS types

### Pending Decisions
1. Should we create a separate webhook microservice immediately?
2. Do we need all PostGIS features upfront or can we migrate gradually?
3. Redis Streams implementation - immediate or phased?

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- Project already has async SQLAlchemy 2 configured (good foundation)
- PostGIS extensions already enabled in db/session.py
- Basic models exist but need geography type upgrades

### Process Insights
- O3 plan is comprehensive but we should implement incrementally
- Focus on getting core functionality working first
- Event sourcing can be added after basic features work
- Clear workflow documentation essential for multi-mode operation
- Cursor Rules help maintain consistency across sessions
